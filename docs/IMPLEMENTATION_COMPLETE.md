- Real-time progress monitoring
- System health tracking
- Audit logging

## 🎯 Key Demonstrations

### Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)
✅ **Type-Safe Messaging**: All communications use Pydantic validation
✅ **Multiple Patterns**: Direct messages, broadcasts, request-response
✅ **Workflow Coordination**: Complex multi-agent research workflows
✅ **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and status reporting

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
✅ **Progress Notifications**: Real-time feedback during long operations
✅ **Security Boundaries**: MCP Roots preventing unauthorized file access
✅ **AI Sampling**: Role-reversal patterns for text improvement
✅ **Tool Integration**: Secure, observable access to external capabilities

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Patterns
✅ **Command & Control**: Orchestrator managing distributed workflow
✅ **Peer Review**: FactChecker providing validation services
✅ **Pub/Sub Broadcasting**: Logger monitoring system-wide activity
✅ **Service Patterns**: Agents providing capabilities to peers
